Introduction *ruby-doc-introduction*

When your cursor is on something you would look up on apidock, type:

- RB for Ruby
- RS for RSpec
- RR for Rails

and the plugin will open a new tab in your browser (or a
new instance of the browser) to the related docs. See the following section
for changing mappings.

Configuration *ruby-doc-configuration* *g:ruby-doc_ruby_command* *g:ruby-doc_mapping*

By default, the plugin uses the xdg-open command to look up the docs but you
can easily change the command. For example, if you are OSX you would like to
change it:

    let g:ruby_doc_command='open'

Furthermore you can choose your own mapping in the following way:

    let g:ruby_doc_ruby_mapping='KK'

There are g:ruby_doc_rspec_mapping and g:ruby_doc_rails_mapping variables
too.
